  ## Installation
  To create your own README, clone the repo down to your local machine so you have the Node project on your local device. Then Run npm install in order to install the package.json and the inquirer. The app will start by running the node index.js       in the command line.       Answer the questions in your command line to generate the README.  

  ## Usage

  When you run node index.js , the application uses the inquirer package to prompt you in the command line with series of questions about your GitHub  project. From there the application will create a table of contets for the README conditionally based on your responses to the Inquirer prompts. Filnally, fs.writeFile is used to create your projects README.md file.
